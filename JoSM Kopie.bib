Abstract Purpose – While (customer) engagement has been proposed as a volitional concept, our structuration theory/S-D logic-informed analyses of actors' (e.g. employees') engagement in service innovation reveal engagement as a boundedly volitional theoretical entity, which arises from actors' structural and agency-based characteristics and constraints. In line with this observation, the purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual model of actor (i.e. customer, firm, employee) engagement with service innovation. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the observed gap, the authors propose an integrative S-D logic/structuration theoretical model that outlines three particular service innovation actors' (i.e. customers', the firm's and employees') engagement, which comprises institution-driven (i.e. fixed) and agency-driven (i.e. variable) engagement facets. In addition, the authors integrate the key expected characteristics of positively (vs negatively) valenced service innovation engagement for each of these actor groups in the analyses. Findings – The authors develop a 12-cell matrix (conceptual model) that outlines particular service innovation actors' institution-driven and agency-driven engagement facets and outline their expected impact on actors' ensuing positively and negatively valenced engagement. Research limitations/implications – The authors discuss key theoretical implications arising from the analyses. Originality/value – Outlining service innovation actors' structure-and agency-driven engagement facets, the authors' model can be used to explain or predict customers', the firm's or employees' service innovation engagement-based activities.},

abstract = {Purpose - Collaborative consumption, such as car sharing, specifically implicates customer-to-customer interaction, which must be regulated by service providers (companies, peers and self-regulating communities), comprising different challenges for business organizations. While in conventional business relations, consumers are protected from undesirable customer behavior by laws, regulations (power) in the context of collaborative consumption are rare, so that trust becomes more relevant. It is the purpose of the study to investigate possible mechanisms to prevent undesirable customers in collaborative consumption. Design/methodology/approach - In between subject designs, samples of 186 and 328 consumers filled in experimental online questionnaires with vignettes. Analyses were made of differences among car sharing companies, private persons and car sharing communities in terms of the power of providers, trust in providers and trust in other users of the shared goods, undesirable customer behavior and consumer-provider relations. Findings - Companies, private persons and self-regulating communities differ in terms of perceived power and trust. Participants specifically perceive mainly coercive power with the car sharing company, but with the private person and the community, reason-based trust in other users is perceived as prevalent. Nevertheless, undesirable customer behavior varies only marginally over the models. Originality/value - The present study is the first to investigate measures to prevent undesirable customer behavior over different collaborative consumption models. This enables appropriate identification of market segments and tailoring of services. The study identifies opportunities for companies in contrast to private persons and self-regulating communities and, in doing so, provides important stimulation for marketing strategy and theory development.},

Abstract Purpose – This study aims to provide a taxonomy of relational benefits that drive customer loyalty in sharing-economy services, assess the relative strengths of these relational benefits in influencing customer loyalty and examine whether commitment mediates the influence of relational benefits on customer loyalty in this context. Design/methodology/approach – Relational benefits of sharing-economy services were explored through a focus group interview, followed by an online survey completed by 440 respondents in China. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Findings – This study shows that confidence and social benefits have significant and positive effects on commitment in sharing-economy services. In addition, safety benefits, a new type of relational benefits, also significantly affect commitment in this context. Furthermore, the findings suggest that commitment acts as a mediator between confidence, social and safety benefits and customer loyalty. Special treatment benefits had no effect on commitment and loyalty in the sharing-economy context. Practical implications – This paper provides sharing-economy service providers with insight on how to better create and sustain loyal relationships with customers through the provision of relational benefits. Originality/value – This study offers initial insight into why customers would stay in peer-to-peer relationships in the sharing economy, and suggests how to strengthen relationships between customers and peer service providers.},

abstract = {Purpose – This work aims to attempt an in-depth study of the link between relationship benefits and store loyalty, examining the moderating role of the retailer's degree of innovation in these relations. Design/methodology/approach – An equations model has been contrasted based on 820 valid individual structured questionnaires administered to consumers of 13 trade names in four retail distribution sectors (food, textile, electronics and household goods). Findings – The results provide evidence of the positive influence of relationship benefits on store loyalty and in particular the benefits stemming from trust. The links between social and special treatment benefits in relation to loyalty are, however, significantly stronger in the less innovative establishments. Research limitations/implications – This paper provides evidence of the moderating role of innovation on the relationship between social benefits and special treatment benefits and loyalty. Practical implications – Technology may be used as a differentiation tool. The retailer should concentrate its investments on information and communications technology solutions that contribute to enhance the customer experience at the point of sale without neglecting the social dimension to increase the benefits of trust and ultimately, customer loyalty. Originality/value – The paper provides an in-depth examination of the retail innovation variable which is scarcely analysed in the literature, offering support for the idea that innovation at the point of sale plays a moderating role in the links between relational benefits and customer loyalty.},

Abstract Purpose – How can some companies be the innovation leader in their industry over prolonged periods of time, whereas others cannot? The purpose of this study is to understand a firm's capability to be a successful serial innovator and to generate a constant stream of industry-leading innovations. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a longitudinal case study approach to gain an understanding of what and how Singapore Airlines sustained service innovation for over 30 years. The study uses triangulation, whereby the core data from in-depth interviews with senior and middle management and frontline employees were complemented with academic research, case studies, annual reports, observations and archival documents. In total, 240 single-spaced pages of interview transcripts with over 130,000 words were analyzed and coded using MAXQDA for identifying repeated patterns of meaning. Findings – The authors identified three key institutional foundations for service innovation: innovation climate (i.e. leadership and service culture), human capital (i.e. recruitment, training and development and engagement and incentives) and resource configurations (i.e. systems, structure and processes). These foundations enabled the organization to build the following four service innovation-related dynamic capabilities: embrace ambidexterity, institutionalize learning and knowledge integration, orchestrate collaboration and reinvent customer value. Interestingly, these institutional foundations and capabilities remained largely stable across 30 years; what changed were the contexts and specifics, not the foundations and capabilities. Research limitations/implications – Data were collected only from one company. Because of the method of thematic analysis, the generalizability of the findings needs further investigation. Originality/value – This study is the first to investigate the drivers of industry-leading sustained service innovation over a prolonged period of time. The proposed framework provides a fuller and more integrated picture of sustained service innovation than past cross-sectional studies.},

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine how empowering consumers by means of co-designing activities influences both positive and negative consumer engagement with new service innovations. Design/methodology/approach – Two experimental studies tested the proposed hypotheses. Participants were asked to imagine co-designing a hypothetical innovation, and then respond to scales that measured intervening variables. The first study measured participants' valuation of the innovation as well as the intention to recommend it. The second study partially replicated the first one but measured participants' perceived severity after a scenario where the innovation failed to deliver its promised performance. Findings – Empowerment triggered a higher sense of engagement through the mediating effects of sense of power and psychological ownership. Subsequently, this effect not only drove more positive evaluations of the innovation but also exacerbated negative evaluations if the service innovation was not delivered successfully. Originality/value – The current study highlights the importance of adopting a psychological perspective toward engagement and shows a balanced view of empowerment in the context of new service innovations.},

abstract = {Purpose The “services triangle” is a dynamic model in which three interlinked entities (customer, employee and firm) combine to create three dyads [employee-firm (EF), customer-firm (CF) and customer-employee (CE)] that work together to deliver services. This study aims to determine whether significant differences exist vis-{\`{a}}-vis the impact of EF, CF and CE dyads on the service experience.Design/methodology/approach Empirical evidence from data garnered from 398 surveys was used to test a conceptual model. To test the hypotheses, like-signed first-order dyads were constructed and combined to create second-order dyads, and analysis of variance and post-hoc tests (least significant differences) were used to investigate whether differences among the second-order dyads exist.Findings The analysis reveals the differential impact of the three services triangle dyads on the service experience. Specifically, customers' perception of EF fit appears to have the greatest impact on customers' evaluation of the service experience, followed by CF and CE fit.Research limitations/implications The main implication is that this paper extends conceptual research by providing empirical evidence that the EF dyad is the foundation of the services triangle. The limitations are based primarily on methodology, where the use of a survey to collect data rules out the potential generalizations of true cause and effect while also potentially being subject to common method bias.Practical implications Managers should realize that fit within some dyads is more instrumental in determining the service experience than fit within others. A number of managerial implications are proposed and discussed.Originality/value Prior research has neither empirically examined the services triangle nor whether significant differences exists among the impact of its dyads on the service experience. Insights from various literatures, the application of the balance theory and the construction of first- and second-order dyads enables an investigation of the various relational patterns contained in the services triangle.

The authors explore employee?s role in a self-service failure and how the presence of other customers can change that role. Specifically, they examine how the self-monitoring of customers behavior during a failure can change recovery preferences. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from customers of a movie self-service ticket kiosk and a grocery self-checkout. Three experiments were conducted. Findings Results from these studies find that customers want employees to fully take over a transaction after a failure if it takes place in isolation. If other patrons are present or waiting in line, then customers prefer the employee to simply correct the problem and let them complete the transaction. Finally, the servicescape along with the presence of other customers in a self-service area can induce self-monitoring behaviors and alter optimal recovery strategies. Research limitations/implications These findings have implications on the appropriate amount of recovery assistance customers need in a self-service experience. Practical implications This research reveals the social and functional complexities associated with executing a satisfactory SST failure recovery, particularly with respect to determining the extent to which the employee or customer should control the attempt. Originality/value This is the first study to examine the employee?s role in a self-service failure. While other studies have examined customers? intentions in a self-service failure, authors examine how a service provider can assist in the recovery of a self-service failure.},
